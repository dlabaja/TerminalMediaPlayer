# TerminalMediaPlayer
Play your favorite videos inside a terminal! Supports all video formats and sound. Up to 80x45 resolution (curently fixed because of stability) and 20 FPS!

**Works on Linux** (Windows can't show colors, you can use https://github.com/dlabaja/ConsoleMediaPlayer instead)

**FFMPEG** is needed to run it (https://ffmpeg.org/)
